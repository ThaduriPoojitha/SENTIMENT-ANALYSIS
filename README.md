##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that aims to determine the emotional tone behind pieces of text. It is widely used in areas such as customer feedback analysis, product reviews, and social media monitoring. The primary objective of this project is to build a sentiment classification model that categorizes textual data into predefined sentiments like positive, negative, or neutral.

In this project, we develop a machine learning-based sentiment analysis system using a logistic regression classifier. We perform text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to predict the sentiment of user-provided statements. This project demonstrates a complete workflow of a real-world NLP application.
